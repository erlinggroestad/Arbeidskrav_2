          class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle
          science and exact art that is potion-making. However, for those select
          few who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the
          mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew
          glory, and even put a stopper in death. Then again, maybe some of you
          have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that
          you feel confident enough to not pay attention!" <br />

          leaves it’s own mark. To have been loved so deeply, even though the
          person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever.”<br> —-
